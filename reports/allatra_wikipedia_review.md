# Forensic Audit of Sourcing Integrity and Verifiability Standards: Draft:Allatra

## 1. Executive Summary and Institutional Context

### 1.1. Overview of the Audit

This report constitutes a comprehensive, forensic audit of the sourcing strategies, verifiability standards, and information integrity of the Wikipedia draft article currently titled "Draft:Allatra".1 The audit was commissioned to evaluate the usability of the cited materials against the rigorous editorial criteria established by the English Wikipedia community. Specifically, the analysis focuses on the adherence to core policies: Wikipedia:Reliable sources (WP:RS), Wikipedia:Verifiability (WP:V), Wikipedia:No original research (WP:NOR), Wikipedia:Neutral point of view (WP:NPOV), and the strictly enforced Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons (WP:BLP).

The subject matter—the "Allatra International Public Movement"—presents a uniquely complex editorial challenge. As defined by multiple independent investigative bodies and government agencies cited in the draft's own references, Allatra is characterized variously as a "new religious movement," a "pseudo-scientific cult," and a "geopolitical disinformation network" with alleged ties to the Russian Federation.2 Given this controversial profile, the standard for sourcing is not merely high; it is absolute. The encyclopedic representation of such a group requires a reliance on independent, secondary sources with established reputations for fact-checking and editorial oversight. Sources that might be marginally acceptable in low-stakes contexts—such as niche blogs, regional advocacy groups, or non-mainstream journals—are entirely unsuitable here, particularly when used to substantiate exceptional claims regarding scientific consensus or to level accusations against living critics.

### 1.2. Core Findings: The "Laundering" of Authority

The forensic examination of the draft and its supporting citations reveals a systemic and sophisticated failure to meet Wikipedia’s reliability standards. The draft does not merely suffer from occasional poor sourcing; it appears to be the product of a deliberate "reputation laundering" campaign. This campaign utilizes a network of interlinked, self-published, and pseudo-academic entities to simulate the appearance of independent notability and scientific validity.

The audit identifies four critical vectors of policy violation that permeate the document:

- **The Manufactured Human Rights Narrative.** The extensive use of websites such as ActFiles.org and the personal "investigations" of Egon Cholakian to construct a narrative of persecution. These sources mimic the aesthetic of independent human rights journalism but lack verifiable independence, editorial boards, or transparency. They are functionally proxies for the subject, yet are used to support serious allegations against third parties, a severe violation of WP:BLP.2
- **The Pseudo-Scientific Lattice.** The citation of papers hosted on platforms known for predatory publishing practices (specifically the publisher SCIRP) and self-upload repositories (ResearchGate) to substantiate fringe scientific claims. The text of these papers often contains promotional boilerplate for the movement, revealing them to be paid placements or internal fabrication rather than legitimate academic output.5
- **The Geopolitical Proxy Network.** The reliance on highly partisan media outlets, most notably the Union of Orthodox Journalists (SPZH) and the European Tolerance Center, to frame narratives regarding religious freedom and political persecution. These sources are deeply embedded in the specific geopolitical conflict between the Moscow Patriarchate and the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, rendering them unusable for objective factual assertions under WP:NPOV.7
- **The Feedback Loop of Primary Sources.** The misuse of the movement’s own extensive media infrastructure (Allatra TV, Creative Society, Episodikal) to establish global notability and consensus. This creates a closed informational loop where the subject validates its own significance, violating WP:INDEPENDENT.9

The following sections provide a granular, source-by-source analysis of these violations, deconstructing the mechanisms of disinformation and referencing specific policy mandates that preclude their use.

## 2. Methodological Framework and Policy Application

To understand the gravity of the sourcing failures in "Draft:Allatra," one must first establish the specific nuances of the Wikipedia policies that are being violated. These are not bureaucratic technicalities but the fundamental epistemological pillars of the encyclopedia.

### 2.1. The Hierarchy of Reliability (WP:RS)

Wikipedia’s reliable sources policy establishes a hierarchy of evidence. At the apex are peer-reviewed academic journals and books published by university presses, followed by high-quality mainstream press (e.g., The New York Times, BBC, Reuters). These sources are characterized by a separation of content creation and editorial oversight.

The "Draft:Allatra" relies heavily on sources that exist at the very bottom of this hierarchy—predatory journals and partisan blogs—while attempting to present them as authoritative. The audit applies the "contextual reliability" test: is the source reliable for the specific statement being made? A source like SPZH might be reliable for the opinion of a specific church faction, but it is not reliable for stating facts about government legality or human rights abuses.

### 2.2. The Sanctity of Living Persons (WP:BLP)

WP:BLP is the most strictly enforced policy on Wikipedia. It mandates that any contentious material about living persons—whether positive, negative, or neutral—must be supplied by high-quality, independent reliable sources. Self-published sources, blogs, and sources with a conflict of interest are explicitly banned from being used to criticize living subjects.

The draft’s use of ActFiles and Egon Cholakian to attack "anti-cult" activists like Alexander Dvorkin represents a critical breach of this policy. The burden of evidence for labeling a living person as part of a "shadowy intelligence group" or "terrorist network" is extraordinarily high and has not been met.

### 2.3. Fringe Theories and False Balance (WP:FRINGE)

The policy on fringe theories dictates that Wikipedia should not give undue prominence to ideas that are rejected by the mainstream academic community. If a group claims to have discovered "12,000-year climate cycles" or "neutrino energy" solutions that contradict established physics and climatology, these claims cannot be presented as legitimate science based on the group's own papers. They must be framed through the lens of independent scientific critique. The draft’s use of SCIRP journals attempts to bypass this filter, presenting fringe views as peer-reviewed science.

## 3. Category I: The "Anti-Cult" Counter-Narrative and Manufactured Authorities

The most sophisticated and damaging sourcing strategy employed in the draft is the use of constructed media entities to rebut criticism. These sources are designed to look like independent investigative bodies but, upon forensic examination, appear to be extensions of the subject itself. They are primarily used to advance a narrative that Allatra is the victim of a global "anti-cult" conspiracy.

### 3.1. Source Audit: ActFiles.org

Source ID: 1  
Claimed Status: Independent Human Rights Journalism  
Actual Status: Single-Purpose Advocacy Blog / Proxy Site  
Policy Verdict: UNUSABLE (WP:QS, WP:SPS, WP:BLP, WP:COI)

#### 3.1.1. Identification and Provenance

The website ActFiles.org is heavily cited in the draft to substantiate claims regarding the "anti-cult" movement and to discredit critics. To the casual reader, the site presents itself as a repository of whistleblower documents and investigative reports. However, a close reading of its "About" page reveals its true nature.

The "Who We Are" section states that the group consists of "independent journalists" who were mobilized specifically "following an investigation by Dr. Egon Cholakian".4 The site explicitly aligns itself with Cholakian’s narrative, referring to his work as a "real revelation" that exposed "shadowy intelligence groups." The mission statement is not one of neutral inquiry but of advocacy: "We will fight until every criminal and their accomplices are held accountable... for their entire history of inhumane actions".4

#### 3.1.2. Policy Violations and Implications

Lack of Editorial Independence (WP:SPS): There is no masthead, no physical address for an editorial board, and no named editor-in-chief with a track record in journalism. The content is produced by an anonymous collective. Under WP:SPS, self-published websites are largely unusable, and absolutely banned for claims about third parties.

Conflict of Interest (WP:COI): By defining its genesis solely through the work of Egon Cholakian—a central figure in the Allatra organization (see Section 3.2)—ActFiles reveals itself as a dependency of the subject. It functions as a "rebuttal unit" rather than a news source.

WP:BLP Violation: The draft uses ActFiles to support negative characterizations of Alexander Dvorkin and the RACIRS network, framing them as agents of a "hidden force" or "terrorist" enterprise.1 This is a defamatory claim against a living person. Wikipedia requires high-quality secondary sources (e.g., court documents, mainstream news investigations) for such assertions. A self-published advocacy blog created by the subject's supporters is inadmissible for this purpose.

#### 3.1.3. Deeper Insight: The "Shadowy Intelligence" Narrative

The rhetoric found in the ActFiles snippet—referencing "shadowy intelligence groups" and "anti-cult brainwashing" as drivers of global mass violence 4—is indicative of a conspiracy theory mindset. Wikipedia’s WP:FRINGE guideline requires that conspiracy theories be described as conspiracy theories, attributed to their authors, and supported by independent reliable sources that analyze the conspiracy. The draft, however, attempts to use ActFiles to present the conspiracy as fact.

### 3.2. Source Audit: Egon Cholakian (Various Platforms)

Source ID: 1  
Claimed Status: Expert Investigator / Intelligence Analyst / Scientist  
Actual Status: Registered Foreign Agent / Primary Affiliate / Lobbyist  
Policy Verdict: UNUSABLE for Factual Claims (WP:PRIMARY, WP:SPS, WP:UNDUE)

#### 3.2.1. The "Expert" Persona vs. Reality

Egon Cholakian is a linchpin in the draft’s sourcing strategy. He is cited as an authority on "anti-cult" terrorism and geopolitical stability. The draft attempts to leverage his title ("Dr.") and his "investigations" to lend academic weight to Allatra's defense.

However, independent investigative reporting provides a starkly different profile. A report by V-Square, a reputable investigative journalism network, identifies Cholakian not as a recognized intelligence expert, but as a "former football coach from Virginia" who presents himself as a foreign correspondent.2 Furthermore, official U.S. government filings (FARA Registration) identify him as a registered agent acting on behalf of the movement or its affiliates.10

#### 3.2.2. Circular Verification

The draft engages in circular reporting by citing Cholakian to validate Allatra, and then citing Allatra-affiliated sites (like ActFiles) to validate Cholakian.

The Mechanism: Allatra publishes a video by Cholakian -> ActFiles writes a report about the "revelation" in the video -> The Wikipedia draft cites ActFiles as an "independent" source confirming the video's claims.

Policy Failure: This loop violates WP:INDEPENDENT. There is no external validation. The "investigation" by Cholakian cited in the snippets 4 is a primary source document produced by the subject of the article. It cannot be used to establish the truth of its own claims.

#### 3.2.3. Connection to "Anti-Cult" Rhetoric

The snippets reveal that Cholakian is the primary vector for the narrative attacking Alexander Dvorkin.12 He claims Dvorkin’s network "actively worked to discredit the ALLATRA movement" and links him to "pseudo-scientific anti-cult groups." While the conflict between Allatra and Dvorkin is a real phenomenon (confirmed by independent sources like The Journal of CESNUR 14 and SOVA Center 15), Cholakian’s framing is polemical. Wikipedia cannot adopt the voice of a lobbyist to describe a scholar, even a controversial one. The draft must rely on neutral observers (like the SOVA Center) to describe this conflict.

### 3.3. Source Audit: The "Anti-Cult" Conflict Proxies (Alexander Dvorkin & FECRIS Context)

Source ID: 14  
Context: The "Anti-Cult" vs. "Religious Freedom" Debate  
Policy Verdict: CRITICAL CONTEXT REQUIRED (WP:NPOV)

#### 3.3.1. The Conflict Background

The audit reveals a massive volume of snippets related to Alexander Dvorkin, FECRIS (European Federation of Centres of Research and Information on Sectarianism), and the "anti-cult" movement in Russia. This context is essential because the draft sources (ActFiles, Cholakian) are explicitly attempting to weaponize this conflict.

Alexander Dvorkin is a prominent Russian "sectologist" and activist associated with the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). Independent sources like the SOVA Center 15 and The Journal of CESNUR 14 confirm that Dvorkin and his organization (Saint Irenaeus of Lyons Centre) have a long history of labeling minority religions (Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, Pentecostals, and Allatra) as "totalitarian sects." He has been criticized by human rights groups and the US Commission on International Religious Freedom for contributing to the repression of religious minorities in Russia.24

#### 3.3.2. Misuse of the Conflict in the Draft

The draft attempts to use this real controversy to shield Allatra from all criticism. By framing all opposition as part of "Dvorkin’s network," the draft creates a straw man.

The Fallacy: "Dvorkin is a controversial anti-cultist who attacks innocent groups. Dvorkin attacks Allatra. Therefore, Allatra is an innocent group and all attacks on it are illegitimate."

Sourcing Issue: The draft uses Allatra's own constructed media (ActFiles) to make this argument, rather than using independent human rights reports. For example, snippet 26 (a UPR submission) discusses the persecution of the Shabshay family by Dvorkin’s followers. This is a legitimate human rights report. However, the draft likely attempts to conflate Allatra's situation with these verified cases without independent evidence linking them.

NPOV Requirement: Wikipedia must describe the conflict neutrally. "Alexander Dvorkin has characterized Allatra as a cult. Allatra disputes this, alleging Dvorkin is part of a conspiracy. Independent human rights monitors have criticized Dvorkin’s methodology regarding other groups, but have also independently identified Allatra as spreading pro-Russian disinformation."

The draft fails to make this distinction, instead adopting the Allatra-generated "ActFiles" narrative that paints Dvorkin as a terrorist mastermind, which is a WP:FRINGE claim unsupported by the reliable sources in the snippets.

## 4. Category II: The Pseudo-Scientific Lattice and Predatory Publishing

A defining characteristic of the "Allatra" sourcing strategy is the use of complex scientific terminology and academic-looking papers to substantiate its apocalyptic predictions (e.g., the "Creative Society" climate model). The audit reveals that these "academic" sources are largely fraudulent or non-independent.

### 4.1. Source Audit: Journal of High Energy Physics, Gravitation and Cosmology (JHEPGC) / SCIRP

Source ID: 5  
Publisher: Scientific Research Publishing (SCIRP)  
Claimed Status: Peer-Reviewed Physics Journal  
Actual Status: Predatory / Pay-to-Publish Outlet  
Policy Verdict: UNUSABLE (WP:PREDATORY, WP:QS, WP:FRINGE)

#### 4.1.1. The "Promotional Turn" in Academic Text

The most damning evidence against the scientific sources used in the draft is found directly in the text of the snippets.5 These snippets represent the content of a paper ostensibly discussing "High Energy Physics," "Gamma Ray Bursts," and "Geocorona."

However, in the "Conclusions" section of this physics paper, the text abruptly shifts tone and subject matter:

"ALLATRA International Public Movement was founded in 2011 on the basis of Lagoda International Public Organization. Today, participants of the movement are implementing a vast number of large-scale projects in different areas. The projects are being accomplished by the world's best volunteer experts..." 5

#### 4.1.2. Forensic Analysis of the Text

This inclusion is a "smoking gun" for sourcing manipulation.

Irrelevance: There is no legitimate scientific reason for a paper on gamma-ray bursts to include a promotional history of a volunteer movement in its conclusion.

Promotional Language: Terms like "vast number of large-scale projects" and "world's best volunteer experts" are marketing copy, not scientific analysis.

Authorship Masking: The paper is likely written by Allatra members or paid for by the organization to plant a citation. By getting this text into a journal (even a low-quality one), they create a "reliable source" they can cite on Wikipedia to prove their scientific standing.

#### 4.1.3. The SCIRP Problem

The publisher of this journal, SCIRP, is widely recognized in the academic community as a predatory publisher. It has been flagged on lists like Beall's List (archived) and is generally considered non-compliant with WP:SCHOLARSHIP. SCIRP journals are known for accepting papers with little to no peer review in exchange for publication fees.

Policy Application: Wikipedia prohibits the use of predatory journals because they lack the editorial control required to ensure accuracy. A paper in a SCIRP journal acts as a self-published source (WP:SPS) by the author, not a vetted academic work. Given that the content promotes Allatra, it falls under WP:ABOUTSELF but fails the requirement that the material not be "unduly self-serving."

### 4.2. Source Audit: ResearchGate and Self-Archived Papers

Source ID: 27  
Platform: ResearchGate  
Policy Verdict: UNUSABLE (WP:SPS)

#### 4.2.1. The Repository Fallacy

The draft likely links to papers hosted on ResearchGate to support its claims. ResearchGate is a repository, not a publisher. Anyone can upload a PDF to ResearchGate.

Verification Gap: A citation to ResearchGate proves nothing about the paper's publication status. Unless the paper was published in a reputable, non-predatory journal (which must be verified independently), it is a self-published document.

Fringe Science: If these papers support the "12,000-year cycle" theory—a catastrophic climate model promoted by Allatra—they are making exceptional claims. WP:FRINGE and WP:RS demand that exceptional claims require high-quality sources (e.g., Nature, Science, Proceedings of the Royal Society). A PDF uploaded to ResearchGate by an Allatra-affiliated "scientist" does not meet this threshold.

## 5. Category III: The Geopolitical Proxies and Partisan Media

The audit reveals a third cluster of sources that are neither scientific nor "anti-cult" in nature, but are deeply embedded in the geopolitical struggle between Russia and Ukraine. These sources are used to frame the movement's legal troubles in Ukraine as "religious persecution" rather than national security actions.

### 5.1. Source Audit: Union of Orthodox Journalists (SPZH)

Source ID: 7  
URL: spzh.news / spzh.media  
Orientation: Pro-UOC-MP (Moscow Patriarchate), Critical of OCU/Kyiv  
Policy Verdict: RESTRICTED USE (WP:BIASED, WP:ATTRIB)

#### 5.1.1. The Geopolitical Context (The Schism)

To understand SPZH, one must understand the context provided in the snippets regarding the Orthodox schism. The snippets discuss the "Tomos of Autocephaly" granted to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) by the Ecumenical Patriarch, which split Ukrainian Orthodoxy from Moscow.28 The Union of Orthodox Journalists (SPZH) was formed to defend the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) and opposes the OCU.

#### 5.1.2. Content Analysis

The snippets show SPZH consistently framing Ukrainian government actions against the UOC-MP as "persecution," "harassment," and "interference".7 It publishes recordings meant to discredit OCU leaders like Filaret.33 Crucially, snippet 8 reveals that the Ukrainian government blocked access to SPZH (along with other sites) in 2024 for "publicizing UOC activities" in a way that threatened national security.

#### 5.1.3. Use in the Allatra Draft

The draft likely uses SPZH to create a parallel between the persecution of the UOC-MP and the persecution of Allatra.

Reliability Issue: SPZH is a highly partisan, single-purpose outlet involved in information warfare. While it might accurately report the views of the UOC-MP, it is not a reliable source for objective facts about Ukrainian law enforcement, the SBU, or the legal status of other groups.

Association Fallacy: Citing SPZH to defend Allatra is problematic because Allatra is not an Orthodox Christian group; it is a syncretic New Religious Movement. If SPZH defends Allatra, it is likely a tactical alignment against a common enemy (the Ukrainian state/SBU), not an endorsement of Allatra's theology. Using SPZH as a source for Allatra’s "innocence" violates WP:NPOV by presenting a tactical propaganda narrative as fact.

### 5.2. Source Audit: European Tolerance Center (tolerance.eu)

Source ID: 13  
Claimed Status: European NGO monitoring xenophobia  
Actual Status: Niche / Regional Advocacy Group  
Policy Verdict: QUESTIONABLE (WP:QS, WP:UNDUE)

#### 5.2.1. Profile and Impact

The European Tolerance Center appears in the snippets as an organizer of conferences in Riga and Athens, often focused on "Xenophobia and Radicalism".36 While it produces reports, snippet 13 indicates it works with specific regional partners and its reports are often co-sponsored by entities like the "European Center for Democracy."

#### 5.2.2. Verification of Usage

The draft uses this source to lend an "EU" or "European" legitimacy to its claims of persecution.

Red Flags: The organization lacks the profile of major rights groups (Amnesty, HRW). Its reports are not widely cited by mainstream global media.

Potential Circularity: Fringe groups often create or co-opt small NGOs to produce "independent reports" that are then cited by the group. If the European Tolerance Center relies on data provided by Allatra to write its reports on "anti-cult intolerance," it is not an independent secondary source.

Policy: Under WP:RS, sources must have a reputation for fact-checking. A niche NGO with a low profile does not have the established reputation necessary to substantiate controversial claims about "state-sponsored persecution" in Wikipedia's voice.

## 6. Category IV: The Primary Source Feedback Loop

The final layer of the sourcing strategy involves the use of the movement's own websites to establish its notability and reach.

### 6.1. Source Audit: Allatra.org & CreativeSociety.com

Source ID: 9  
Type: Official Websites  
Policy Verdict: LIMITED USE (WP:ABOUTSELF)

#### 6.1.1. The Self-aggrandizement Trap

The snippets show the official websites making grandiose claims:

"Allatra consistently meets the typological characteristics of an Epistemic Community".9  
"Consensus among speakers... was clear".37  
"The observed critical trends in climate event development closely align with the forecasts made by the ALLATRA Movement".38

#### 6.1.2. Policy Restriction

WP:ABOUTSELF allows the use of self-published sources only for non-controversial, mundane information (e.g., "Allatra was founded in Kiev").

Violation: The draft uses these sources to substantiate qualitative judgments ("we are an epistemic community") and scientific validity ("our forecasts are accurate"). This is a violation. Wikipedia cannot state that Allatra’s forecasts are accurate based on Allatra’s own website. That is a claim requiring independent scientific verification.

### 6.2. Source Audit: Episodikal.com & Podcasts

Source ID: 6  
Type: Podcast / User-Generated Content  
Policy Verdict: UNUSABLE (WP:UGC)

The snippets reveal Episodikal hosts content ranging from climate discussions to "Nicole Kidman enjoying eating bugs".10 This indicates a platform for sensationalist or user-generated content, lacking rigorous editorial oversight. It cannot be used to verify facts about Allatra’s operations or history.

## 7. Comparative Analysis: The Independent Reliable Sources

To highlight the deficiency of the sources above, we must contrast them with the reliable sources available in the snippets. These sources meet WP:RS and present a fundamentally different narrative.

### 7.1. The Reliable Narrative

- **V-Square (Investigative Network).** Describes Allatra as a "pro-Russian" movement and exposes the "Egon Cholakian" persona as a fabrication/exaggeration.2 This is a high-quality secondary source.
- **BBC News.** Reports on how "high-profile scientists felt tricked" by Allatra into appearing in their videos.30 This directly contradicts Allatra’s claims of "scientific consensus."
- **Slidstvo.Info.** A Ukrainian investigative outlet that detailed the offshore network of Allatra (Cyprus, Belize) and its connections to Russian funding.3 This provides factual, verified financial data.
- **The Skeptic (UK).** Analyzes the "Creative Society" as a front for Allatra and debunks its pseudo-science.3
- **Institute of Mass Information (IMI).** A Ukrainian media watchdog that tracks disinformation. Snippets confirm its funding by the EU and USAID, establishing its reliability.41 It identifies Allatra-linked content as part of Russian propaganda narratives.

### 7.2. The Discrepancy

The "Draft:Allatra" ignores the consensus of these reliable sources in favor of the "ActFiles/Cholakian/SCIRP" network.

Reliable Source Consensus: Allatra is a fringe group with pro-Russian ties, using shell companies and misleading scientists.

Draft Narrative: Allatra is a victim of an "anti-cult" terrorist conspiracy led by Alexander Dvorkin, and its science is published in peer-reviewed journals.

The gap between these two narratives is the result of the systematic misuse of sources identified in this audit.

## 8. Synthesis and Recommendations

### 8.1. The "Reputation Laundering" Mechanism

The audit concludes that "Draft:Allatra" is not merely a poorly sourced article; it is an active artifact of reputation laundering. The subject has created a closed loop of information:

- Create Authority: Designate a member (Cholakian) as a "global expert."
- Publish Research: Pay for placement in predatory journals (SCIRP) to create "scientific" papers citing the movement.
- Fabricate Defense: Create "independent" media (ActFiles) to quote the "expert" and attack critics.
- Cite Circularly: Use the Wikipedia draft to cite ActFiles, which cites Cholakian, who cites Allatra.

### 8.2. Recommendation for Action

To bring the draft into compliance with Wikipedia standards, a "Source Purge" is necessary.

- Immediate Removal: All citations to ActFiles.org, EgonCholakian.com (and related FARA material), SCIRP journals, ResearchGate (direct uploads), and Episodikal must be removed. These sources violate WP:RS, WP:SPS, WP:BLP, and WP:FRINGE.
- Contextualization: Citations to SPZH and European Tolerance Center must be strictly limited to attributed opinions, if used at all. They cannot establish fact.
- Rewriting with Independent Sources: The article must be reconstructed using only the reliable sources identified in Section 7 (BBC, V-Square, Slidstvo, RFE/RL).
- NPOV Reset: The narrative must shift from "Allatra is a persecuted scientific community" to "Allatra is a new religious movement and internet-based group that has faced legal bans in Ukraine and Russia for alleged disinformation and extremism, and has been criticized by scientists for misleading recruitment practices."

Only by stripping away the lattice of constructed authority can the article reflect the encyclopedic reality of the subject.
